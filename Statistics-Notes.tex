\abstract{I briefly review some of the basic notions of 
parametric Bayesian statistical inference that have come up in my research.
These notes are not self contained and remain a work in progress! 
I assume some familiarity with probability
theory and statistics, on the level of the first few chapters of
\cite{wasserman2010statistics}. 
I may sometimes implicitly assume some knowledge of differential geometry
and partial differential equations.
I try to cite sources whenever possible (whenever I can remember the source
I learned something from), although the purpose of these notes
are to serve more as a statistics ``cheat sheet'' than a formal review.
If you think I am missing a reference please let me know.
Please contact me if you find any errors! 

The notation is: vectors/tensors are in \textbf{boldfont}. 
Indices are denoted with lower case latin letters, e.g. the $i^{th}$ component of the vector
$\bv$ is $\left(\bv\right)_i = v_i$. We typically do not use boldfont when we explicitely
write down indices.
Repeated indices are summed over.
Capital $P$ always represents a probability distribution, $\bx$ always
represents an instantiation of measured data, $\btheta$ always represents
model parameters. More generally, model parameters are represented by 
greek letters, while data is represented by latin letters. 
Random variables are always capatalized. Partial derivatives are denoted
by $\partial$, and covariant derivatives by $\nabla_i$ (for our purposes,
you can usually replace covariant derivatives with partial derivatives).

I thank Rohit Chandramouli for helpful conversations, and a lecture on
model selection that inspired the creation of these notes, 
and Simone Mezzasoma for helpful comments that have led to a clearer presentation.
